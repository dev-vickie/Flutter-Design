Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd project-name
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command.You can name your branch anything you want,even your name,but keep it short:

```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-ui-changes
```

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
